## Feature

-  Conversion from raw timestamp generatated in Matlab application to python's timestamp type

-  Find a scattered point that is closest to the location of a reference line just moved and relocate the line right on the point 

-  Synchronization of x and y axis movement, zoom in/out, and also the location of reference lines between each plot

-  Dynamic number of graphs rendered based on the number of signal log data

-  Panda DataFrame handling

## Limitation

 - Synchronization generally occurs with a time delay that varies in degree of the size of
a data set.
