## Feature

- Conversion from raw timestamp data generatated in Matlab application to python's timestamp type

-  Find a scattered point that is closest to the location of a reference line and relocate the line right on the point 

-  Synchronization of x and yaxis movement, zoom, and reference line's location between all of plots

-  Dynamic number of graphs rendered based on the number of singal log data

-  Panda DataFrame handling

## Limitation

 - Synchronization generally occurs with a time delay that varies in degree of the size of
a data set.
